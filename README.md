# Workcalendar.
I Created a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

The app display standard business hours (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.). Each time slot represent one hour and contain the following:

The time

A field to hold user input

A save button

Clicking on the save button will store the time and user input in localStorage.
